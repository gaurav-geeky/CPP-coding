#  QUEUE 
// here insertion is from back   and deletion from front side :  it is called singlly queue.  

// pop is for deleting data and move pointer further. 
// here data represent thr.  while loop    untill queue is empty

# for loop is used for certainity when know initial and start.  

# while loop is used for uncertainity  becase we know end point.  



# DEQUE : double ended queue 

1. can insert amd delete data from   both sides.  
2. we can delete from  front, back &  middle.   
3. it is non contiguous memory.  
4.   auto is a pointer , it can point anything . 



auto  works on pointer to copy value 

&  ampercent works on  address.  

here data is not deleted  just   pointer move forward.
