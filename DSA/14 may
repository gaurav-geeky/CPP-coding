// asymptotic notation :  to measure time complexity and space complexity 
//  
// 3 types,       3 cases        
// Big O   O __  worst case     ____ ans in descending  ____ tak much time 
//  Omega    ___ best case   ______ ans in ascending order  ____ take less time
//  Theta   ___ average case  ________ ans in random order. ____ take some time. 

//  units differs things   $ 5  !=  rupe 5 

// Big O  is worst :  it is always taken to solve because if it runs in worst case then can   easily run in average and best case . 

// n,  n2,   n log n
