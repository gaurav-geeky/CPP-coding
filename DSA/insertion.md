//  insertion sort , huger data no bubble, but small me yes.  

// it is also called as online algo : becasue we are comparing data with current data (online)  ,,    

//  index always start from zero index  from left to right ascending.   only compare with single data.  

// array class is made in STL to  stop extra iteration    because   in 3.5 version   array  run out of bond in loop (when give more than length) 

// run acc to length .  so not garbge value.  
// dont use  static value , in case change size of array. 

//  arr.length =  sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);   use   full formula;      learn basic formula how it happend ? 



#  quick sort  

if p    q  not not  cross itself the n  swap      index of  p and q .  

if p   q  croses  then       index of pv  and -ve swaps .  

selected pivot elements will be form  the sorted array : quick sort.
