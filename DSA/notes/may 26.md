//   for small data bubble is best   but for the bigger data  takes much time .  dictionary pattern is solved using bubble sort.

# no ascending or duplicacy  then  not stable
no stable in random condition; 


# array ke size me kaam hua  in place  

array ke size se zyada liya   not in place.  


#  in place is related to space complexcity   if extra array then  sp com become  order N + order N =  2N;
